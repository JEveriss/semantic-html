          In November 1977, the Buzzcocks were on a headline tour of the UK.
          Before a gig at the Clouds (also known as the Cavendish Ballroom) in
          Edinburgh, they stayed the night. Pete Shelley later recalled:
          <blockquote>
            "We were in the Blenheim Guest House with pints of beer, sitting in
            the TV room half-watching Guys and Dolls. One of the characters,
            Adelaide, is saying to Marlon Brando's character, 'Wait till you
            fall in love with someone you shouldn't have.' "I thought, 'fallen
            in love with someone you shouldn't have?' Hmm, that's good."
          </blockquote>

          <aside>
            The following day Shelley wrote the lyrics of the song, in a van
            outside the main post office on nearby Waterloo Place. The music
            followed soon after. In an interview, Shelley said that the song was
            about a man named Francis Cookson that he lived with for about seven
            years.

          The song was ranked at No. 1 among "Tracks of the Year" for 1978 by
          NME. Critic Ned Raggett describes the song as a
          <em>"deservedly well-known masterpiece."</em> Mark Deming notes,

          <blockquote>
            "Pete Shelley's basic formula in the Buzzcocks was to marry the
            speed and emotional urgency of punk with the hooky melodies and
            boy/girl thematics of classic pop/rock. When he applied this
            thinking to that most classic of pop themes, unrequited teenage
            love, he crafted one of his most indelible songs,

            >"
          </blockquote>

          Writing for Pitchfork, Jason Heller called the song
          <blockquote>"the peak...of the Buzzcocks' legacy",</blockquote>
          and said that
          <blockquote>
            "It’s a tribute not only to the notion that punk can be a thoughtful
            expression of naked feeling, but to Buzzcocks’ idiosyncratic embrace
            of the finer points of classic pop songcraft."
